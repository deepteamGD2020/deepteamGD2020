Yessica Deira (1994) is a graphic designer, DJ and producer experimenting in re-constructing collective consciousness through design, film, sound, music and performance.

Her work MOKSI (2020) is an ongoing live performative piece in which the artist explores the private nature of analogue archives and the fast-paced outpouring of digital productions. She aims to expand her cultural knowledge about Surinam and tells her story through found footage (sound and visuals) questioning the preservation of archival material.

MOKSI intends to encourage the current and future continuers and consultants of the archive to speculate together about the form and interpretation.
