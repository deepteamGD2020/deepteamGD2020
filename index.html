        <p>loud softness: the art of gentle protest <br> </p>
        <p><br>
          Activism often conjures up quick transactional signing of petitions, loud and aggressive ways to demand justice outside on streets. For people from the Quiet World, most forms of traditional activism are uncomfortable, stressful, and sometimes terrifying. Is it even possible for introverts using their gentle voices to create big change? How can different personality types call for change? ‘Loud Softness: the Art of Gentle Protest’ invites you to the realm where craft marries activism. Through an extensive web archive and woven tapestry, Anastasia would like to manifest and draw attention to the idea that a creative gentle approach to activism can be even more world changing both personally and politically.

        <p><br>
          <i>... The scraggly charm bracelet you can’t find the courage to throw out, the random knick-knacks that deposited on the shelves, the calendars received every Christmas from your mother, the rocks picked up while walking, the old pile of rags mended over and over again...</i><br>
          By letting owners speak about their mundane belongings and what they remind them of, Domestic Tales – Odes to Triviality is a collection of short stories that invites the reader to reconsider the value of the often diminished ordinary. Especially now, in a moment of time where the domestic space has become crucially central in our daily experience, the house turns into a theatre of memorabilia and repeated gestures, a place for recollections of stories and references. Through the words of their owners objects come to life; they animate oral narratives depicting the grounding role of domesticity. The project dives into humans’ intimate relations with the realm of objects through a mainly written but also audio form. It presents itself as a book; an object that speaks and that functions as a platform for sharing. <br>

        <p>now and then<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          The past is full, full of eras distinguished by people and culture. The future is empty, but hot. ‘NOW AND THEN’ manipulates time by looking at the past and the future as parallel lines, lines of THENs, growing from NOW. This way a sense of past humanity is reflected into a heating future, lending it an ethos to better imagine what is at stake and when. Climate action is an action of respecting and loving the life and humanity on the Earth now and in the Future. It is now, in this critical decade, our responsibility to practice radical love!

        <p>Things and what we make of them<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          ‘Things and what we make of them’ is a performance that functions as a metaphorical anthology for the topic of queerness, which is portrayed as a liquid matter defined by movement. ‘Things and what we make of them’ asks implicitly through visuals and explicitly through spoken word, what remains of fluidity when we attempt to acknowledge it. Does defining a liquid matter cause it to solidify? Does the ‘in between’ need borders for it to exist as such, in the same way that water needs a carrier in order to hold shape? As placeholders for fluid sexualities and genders, the work references varying matters such as semiotics and alchemy symbols, as well as the lived, physical experience. In showing a constant flux of material and movement, the project becomes queer itself; it is defined as it flows.

        <p>hypnosis of the stolen painting<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          When the real catches fire, borders are abolished, one zone—one space—crosses another and it is the whole world that becomes, to one degree or another, a gigantic theme park...
          <br><br>
          ‘Hypnosis of the stolen painting’ is a video work questioning the nature of what surrounds us—the existence of imaginary and imagined worlds and spaces that are intertwined in what we call reality. Clara Lezla interviewed actors of these worlds or people who study them, and asked them to share their insights and intuitions about the different ways of unfolding fiction. The result is embodied in three visually distinct, yet echoing gates, built out of components of the worlds which they refer to. They can be seen as portals, trompe l’oeil, facades that harness the same principle of a cathedral frontispiece; that is to give visual information of the chemistry operating behind the walls—or in this case—of a fun fair attraction; to re appropriate an imagery and copy artefacts to a point at which we are disturbed, not knowing what we are looking at anymore... It makes us recall the cardboard cut out, the Hollywood decor, the setting. The gates are opened. It’s an invitation to enter. But what lies beyond? Nothing.... or everything. One gate leads into another, they belong to the same place; the simulacra of reality where the porosity of the borders between fiction and reality is always challenged.

          On a daily basis we consume multiple grams of toxic ingredients trough the cosmetic products that we wear. With the project ‘True Colours’, Dana Doorenbos wants to bring light to the blind spots of the cosmetic industry, highlighting the deceptive ways in which they sell their products in order to disguise the truth. The project is divided into <span class="samboSpan">3</span> sections: <span class="samboSpan">1</span>. The expectation the company creates through the invention of new words and product names; <span class="samboSpan">2</span>. The Promises that they make when advertising a product; and <span class="samboSpan">3</span>. The reality of what is actually in their products and what their effects are on the planet.
          <br>
          By dissecting existing advertisements strategies and stripping down all of the distracting glamour, she uncovers the tricks behind the language used by the cosmetic industry.

        <p>flaporen lexicon<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          A norm is a translation of the underlying values of a group or society into concrete rules of conduct and regulations. These particular rules can be written or unwritten. Norms guide social actions because people often unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the norms of the situation. The Flaporen Lexicon is a linguistic inventory that analyses the Dutch word ’flaporen’, better known as ‘stick-out ears’; it is a collection of fragments of written texts concerning stick-out ears. What are the negative and positive connotations of the dutch word ‘stick-out ears’? In The Flaporen Lexicon, you will discover the history, evolution and relationship between ‘flaporen’ and judgmental words, which guided the creation of an accompanying fictional cosmetic ear product.

          In his work, Edward Dżułaj is stressing the danger of far-right notions spread in Poland by political parties like the ONR. ONR—which means National Radical Camp—was founded in <span class="samboSpan">1934</span>. It is a far-right Polish organization with doctrines stemming from pre-Second World War fascism. For his graduation project, Edward created his own Private Press armed with a scalpel and an airbrush, with which he manually censored all of the content created by the ONR spanning across the last <span class="samboSpan">86</span> years. By doing so, he changes the frequency of the voice of the far-right and in turn removes them from history. The process and outcome of the act of censoring are documented in the form of a book, several posters and a web extension.

          Is there a better feeling than breathing clean, fresh air straight out of the Dyson Pure Cool <span class="samboSpan">TP01</span>?<br>
          As clean air becomes scarcer, more products claiming to restore air quality are entering the market. ‘Particulate Matters’ explores the commodification of clean air by studying the language of air-purifier commercials. In this project, CGI mascots of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ air particles have been directly extracted from different air-purifier commercials. The air particles have been personified with scripted speaking roles. By re-contextualizing the virtually branded air-particles, ‘Particulate Matters’ aims to reveal the overlapping lexicons of cleanliness and right-wing speech and highlight the sombre reality that air purifiers are masking.

          Eerste Hulp Bij Ongemak (First Aid for Inconvenience) is an audiovisual series about the social inconvenience that lingers around the discourse on being invisibly different. It displays the perplexity that unfolds during daily conversations and the linguistic tools that people create to tackle them. Fien conducted in-depth field research on the interspace that exists around and between labels, diagnoses, (physical) disabilities, and further differentiations from the social norm. As a result, she highlights the overlaps across different personal experiences that find their origins in this interspace. The work functions as a documentation of this overlap and as a platform that offers recognition and support to these invisible groups.

        <p><br>
          Once again, Iran is facing a new wave of protests, this time sparked by the rising price of gasoline. These protests quickly became an outlet for broader frustrations: the joyless religious dictatorship. ‘Beginnings Without Endings’ introduces a timeline of these events inspired by flags that are displayed in Iran during Ashura festivals, flags that traditionally commemorate Hussain’s martyrdom, sayings of the prophet, verses from the Quran, or quotes from Khomeini and other important figures. These phrases are replaced by the slogans and phrases used by the protesters who have been shut down by the regime. The banners serve as a sign of grief, serving as an expression of sadness tied to these events, manifesting the on-going anger aimed towards the Iranian government.

        <p><br>
          Along with the development of South Korea’s modernity, K-Pop’s territory has been expanding to other parts of the world. Strongly established as a cultural product, K-Pop is popularised by and for the global audience of today, altering the definition of globalness with the same ideology and power structure as in the colonial past. With ‘The Global K’, Kihyeon visualises the hybridity of K-Pop culture with an aim to question its origins and motives aided by the nationalistic mentality and capitalistic drive. At the same time, the project acts as a personal exploration of a balance between celebration and contemplation of her own culture.

          Prenatal screening has been standardized in many countries to detect potential medical defects. These developments have steadily reduced the number of hereditary diseases and conditions. Kiki, who herself has Cystic Fibrosis—one of the diseases eradicated at a rapid rate by current developments—draws on personal experience to investigate the tension between the clinical and impersonal ways the medical field deals with prenatal testing: the unrealistic, happy faced, pastel-colored graphic design that is used to advertise such tests, and the raw and often emotional realities of dealing with such decisions.

          ‘Biblically Responsible Investing’ by Laura Brouwer is a video installation and mixed media sculpture showing the relevance of religion’s entry into the daily practice of global financing. Biblically Responsible Investing (BRI) is a Christian investment approach that aligns with the investor’s faith and biblical beliefs. Christian investors exclude companies from their investment portfolios that are involved in affairs such as abortion, contraception, and the LGBTQ community. Indirectly, God is the portfolio manager. Laura did extensive research and discovered open-source BRI databases and screening tools to scan for so-called ‘sin stocks’. In these databases, Christian portfolio managers are constantly keeping track of companies’ violations and update reports with detailed descriptions of infringements. The data of this research is reflected in the video installation and mixed media sculpture.

        <p>remnants of digital ephemerality<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          ‘Remnants of Digital Ephemerality’ is a layered digital landscape painting and series of engraved marble fragments by Linda van Houtum displaying the transience of the digital image. Through the use of programming whose aim is to compare compressed imagery and extract the generated loss, the scenery transforms into a reversed painting, using compression as the paintbrush.
          <br><br>
          This colourful landscape of transience takes form through the compilation of multiple layers, sourced from a range of different compressions, which use a variety of methods of preservation, therefore creating unique variations of these images. By transforming compression into a tool of creation, the remnants of the images are morphed into a landscape, and therefore become lossless and everlasting.

        <p><br>
          ‘We experience, meet, create, laugh, feel, hit, love, fall… for sensual attraction. <br>
          ‘Hey Do You Come Here Often?’ welcomes you to experience a series of face calls attempting to grasp the invisible streams of desire which link different bodies together. Through the call platform, different interviews intertwine with each other in order to deconstruct and understand the different narratives of attraction; attraction as a form of love, power, temptation, architecture…  <br>
          The collection of diverse voices comes alive in one unique body performing all of the different characters, each one calling from their own habitat. <br>
          Lying somewhere between cliché and irony, the project wants to open up a safe place for discussion. An ode to our diverse intimacy! Butterflies in the stomach, silent, but yes! It’s happening!

        <p>The Matter of Progression<br> </p>
        <p><br>
          Trying to understand the world around us has been a long road. Mankind is inherently currious and we are creative in finding ways to explain natural phenomenon. The Classic Elements theory is a famous one, even though science has moved past it. As we discover and understand more, we start to use the world around us to our own advantage and making life seemingly easier.
          <br>However, technological progression has become a destructive force, impossible to slow down. Ever since the rise of agriculture, humanity is forces to push itself beyond what was believed to be possible. Society is ever evolving and these changes put more and more pressure on the individual but also on the world around us.
          <br>With my project I mix the old and the new, showing that technological progression is something inevitable.

          Electronic gaming is the single most popular pastime, providing endless rewards for bite-size challenges at hardly any risk. The recent explosion of online gaming communities has added a social incentive to life in the virtual world. This research project explores the divided attitudes towards virtual life: Why do people spend so much time online, to the point of abandoning the “real” world? Why do people look down on the virtual world, discounting it without having experienced it? Marc van den Berg has constructed a VR-experience that brings the opposing views closer together by highlighting the riches of the virtual world, and the cost at which they come.

Taking the form of a theatrical performance, ‘Dope Show’ analyses the extreme mental and physical process of mutating into the illusion of the image of perfection, and explores power as an ultimate goal.

          ‘Domestic Nature’ is a series of home crafted tools that simulate sensations that can be found in nature. The project is a critique of the popular desire to go back to a more primitive lifestyle in nature, as evidenced by the abundance of survival and camping videos online. These videos depict nature as a utopia, a place where man can live free of worries and modern problems in harmony with their environment, surrounded by the calming qualities of nature. However, in reality, nature can be extremely harsh and cruel. These tools make fun of this unfounded desire for survivalism and instead encourage the viewer to find and experience nature closer to home.

          <br><br>
          With each upswing in technology, we meet our perceived static nature shifting. We fear what we don’t understand and project new meaning trough magical thinking and cooperate utopias, as we feed from different tabs of knowledge. Creating a disembodiment from a collective grounding, a detachment from a universal reality to an attachment to a subjective one. ‘Once upon a Nowʼ navigates through these different belief systems, rhetorics and events surrounding the phenomena of 5G by transposing them into a digital theatre play which demonstrates truths, magical thinking and the traction of conspiracy theories in the style of the absurd.

          The Bulgarian Chalga is a music genre from the Balkans which has been largely regarded as low culture with its scandalous videos and provocative lyrics. However, it is an invaluable part of Bulgarian culture and history. In the Chalgarhythms web archive, a massive collection of over <span class="samboSpan">8000</span> songs displays the ‘chalga universe’. Aesthetically tickling the viewer with a mix of camp neon and blinding lustre, it welcomes anybody in a party mood or on the lookout for specific pieces of information.

        <p><br>
          Nicolai Schmelling works experimentally with image across the fields of graphic design, illustration and moving image. Their graduation work ‘Pictures of Images’ is part of an on-going research on image materiality. The work springs from the question: If an image is an object of knowledge, which knowledge is that exactly?<br>
          Through a carefully developed technique, mundane video material becomes abstracted. The movements of the person guiding the imaging device smudge the image and paint a picture. The most consistent parts of the image remain recognizable. However, the blurred periphery, seemingly animated and alive, becomes the new point of interest, shifting what is knowable from the image to something beyond the frame and surface. <br>
          As a guide to critically observing one’s own image making, Nicolai has formulated a written meditation, exhibited alongside the video displays as a resource. After rhythmically leading the reader to be attentive of their imaging device, the text ends with the encouragements: Make an image. What is your image a document of? You don’t have to look at it. Make a picture of your image.

          When social isolation is required for the best of the community, can we make use of our collective memories as a tool to defeat loneliness? During the last few months, Nicoletta Radice took upon the challenge to create a chatbot. By feeding the bot her memories from her own life and from those of other people, Nicoletta created ‘MemoryBot — a bot for memory back-up and memory exchange’. MemoryBot is an interactive fictitious web application. It serves as memory storage, specifically created to generate new memories which for the user’s benefit. MemoryBot is not a replacement for human contact, but instead it is a speculative solution for aid and support, an exploration into the creation of artificial emotions, a project in which human emotions and memories are summoned up by an emotionless machine.

How have streaming services changed the way we consume, produce and present music and musicians? Streaming services don't sell millions of different commodities to its users, rather just the one: the subscription itself.
          <br><br>
          ‘The Beat Goes On’ explores the implications of audio streaming, using the platform itself as the pages of a manifesto. Through song and interview it presents different perspectives with the intention of hosting a discourse: let’s make an effort to critically look at this new format in a way that benefits us all, as consumers and craftsmen.

          Insert > rotate > trace​ — the spinning dots indicate that the computer is doing its part: rest, the hand might be idle now. <br>
          Track > evaluate > optimize​ — your actions have been recorded: follow the instructions to improve performance. <br>
          The observation of workflows and overfamiliar formulas for productivity trigger the viewer to question what manual labour might look like in the future. Selina translates these gestures into plaster as an alternative method of quantification. The resulting archive acknowledges what slips standardisation: the unexpected, the experimental and the play.

          If the world’s water is transforming, so are its fish. When enough fishes die, their souls will gather and wake us up at night. The panoramic map of ‘The New Pangasius’ is a constellation of both found and made materials speaking of the highly commercialized and cultivated species of catfish in Vietnam, the Pangasius. Through the use of animated folktales, witty conversations, sketchy found footage and plasticky virtual objects, the project tries, without the need of scientific precision, to prove and reveal the complexities surrounding this chain of supply—“the dissociation of brand from factory”, “the relaxation of borders to trade, and the global consolidation of corporate power.”

          <br><br>
          The narrative develops through a building and breaking of etymologies and building blocks of certain terms, word-making as a political act. By understanding how language creates collective conventions, we can play with it to subvert them. The multiple storylines draw parallels and perpendiculars between language, collective rituals, industrial work and domestic food production through a historical, linguistic and associative lens. Dirty knowledge.

          The installation “As It Came Out of the Earth, It Returns” <span class="samboSpan">(2020)</span> by Kert Viiart is a work that critically explores plastic as a matter and artefact from an archeological point of view.

Also, he is speculating about the future scenario when plastic merges together with the ancient ruin.<br>
          “As It Came Out of the Earth, It Returns” is an installation consisting of <span class="samboSpan">7</span> sculptural pieces and a video <span class="samboSpan">(5’46’’)</span>. The work revolves around the contemporary archaeological displays, the plastic-based support structures, and building materials, questioning the choice of materials in use.

        <p>base world, documenting ramstein<br> </p>
        <p><br>

          The US military base Ramstein Air Base is located in the south west of Germany, a cold war remnant that is a crucial geopolitical element in todays warfare infrastructure.<br>
          The digital space Base World, documenting Ramstein observes the impacts of Ramstein Air Base in intertwinement with the German state. It leads towards the understanding of the complexity of globalized military presence.<br>
          Military bases have to be understood as a military presence that extends beyond its facilities. They are presented as having rational, strategic purposes. Bases have not simply been planned in keeping with strategic and political goals. The military as a corporation profits from their continued existence.<br>
          Alongside their military and political economic purposes, bases have of course as well symbolic and psychological dimensions. <br>
          Growing up near the largest US military base outside the US, the presence of the military was a normalized part of my everyday life.That led me to the questions:<br>
          • What does the extension of a body mean?<br>
          • How can it be that the military logic is rendered almost invisible?<br>
          • How does it make us active accomplices?<br>
          I drew together six narrations connected to Ramstein Air Base. <br>
          Three stories are told by the personal voice of people who lived or still live in the area, based on interviews. The interviews are woven into eachother describing the shared but still separated, parallel experience. <br>
          The cases visualized through scanned fragments open the personal up to systemic violence caused by a military base in entanglement with its host country on a local and global level. <br>
          The six narrations can be viewed in a linear sequence or the user can explore alternative connections through switching between story and case. <br>
          The context of the cases is extended through related links and archive material collected during the research for my thesis Base and Host — the production of violence and resistance.<br>
